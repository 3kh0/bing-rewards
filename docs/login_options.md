## Additional Login Security Options
Microsoft offers these additional security options:
- Passwordless account: No password, tap the correct number from your authenticator app
- Two-step verification: You'll have to enter a security code that is sent to you via email or authenticator app

Currently `only passwordless is supported` and it must be done through the `Microsoft Authenticator app.

Each time you log-in, a code will be printed out in the `command line console`, and you will need to select it in Authenticator. You will have to do this an additional time when you do the mobile search.
